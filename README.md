Task management is the process of effectively and efficiently tracking, managing, and executing the life cycle of a task or many tasks within a project, from inception to execution. The purpose of task management is to improve the decision-making, communication, efficiency, and effectiveness of a task or project.

Managing tasks is something that most adults do in their daily lives. Take running a household, for example. Whether you are single or have a family, you have to manage your time and energy throughout the day to complete tasks like attending work meetings, cleaning up, buying groceries, and more.

On a project team, task management requires you to have organizational skills and strategic thinking. You'll also need to know how to use apps and software, as well as manual methods like task lists and charts.
