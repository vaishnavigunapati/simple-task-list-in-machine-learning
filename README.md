## Aim:
To create  the task managemnet app tool with the help of machine learning in python.
## Description
Develop a Python **task management app** for adding, removing, listing, prioritizing, and receiving task recommendations based on task descriptions.
## what is task managment tool?
Task management is the process of effectively and efficiently tracking, managing, and executing the life cycle of a task or many tasks within a project, from inception to execution. The purpose of task management is to improve the decision-making, communication, efficiency, and effectiveness of a task or project.
Managing tasks is something that most adults do in their daily lives. Take running a household, for example. Whether you are single or have a family, have to manage  time and energy throughout the day to complete tasks like attending work meetings, cleaning up, buying groceries, and more.
On a project team, task management requires  to have organizational skills and strategic thinking. You'll also need to know how to use apps and software, as well as manual methods like task lists and charts.
### Steps to find the task mangement tool:
- Add the task to the list.
- Remove the tasks.
- List tasks
- Recommend tasks
- Exit the tasks

## what is feature Extraction?
Feature extraction is a process in data analysis and machine learning where relevant information is extracted from raw data to create a reduced and more meaningful representation of the data. In various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and signal processing, feature extraction plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of algorithms.
### The goal of feature extraction is to:
* Simplify the Data 
* Improve Performance
* Remove Redundancy
* Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
* Word Embedding
## what is navie bayies?
Naive Bayes is a simple and probabilistic classification algorithm based on Bayes' theorem, which describes the probability of an event based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. Despite its simplicity, Naive Bayes is surprisingly effective and widely used in various applications, especially in natural language processing tasks like text classification and spam filtering.
### formula
P(A∣B)=p(B/A).P(A)/P(B)
#### Types of Naive Bayes:
There are different variants of Naive Bayes, such as:
- Multinomial Naive Bayes: Used for discrete data, often in text classification problems.
- Gaussian Naive Bayes: Assumes that the features follow a normal distribution and is suitable for continuous data.
- Bernoulli Naive Bayes: Designed for binary feature data, where features represent presence or absence.
## Setting up the task management tool
## step 1:
Install pip pandas,numpy.
## step 2:
Import the data
## Step 3:
Apply the model of feature extraction and Navie bayies.
## Step 4:
Import pipeline for both
## Step 5:
### MAIN MENU
- add the studens to the list
- Remove a students by description
- List students
- Recommended students
- Exit the students
### FINALLY THE TASK MANAGEMENT APP WAS FORMED.
## Conclusion:
In conclusion, a task management tool is a powerful ally in the quest for productivity and success, whether on an individual or team level. The right tool can streamline processes, enhance collaboration, and contribute to a more organized and efficient work environment. As technology continues to evolve, task management tools are likely to play an increasingly integral role in optimizing how we manage and accomplish our daily tasks and projects.
